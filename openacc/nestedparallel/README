Application: Porting Matvec routine to GPU using OpenACC

Problem:     Matrix Vector Multiplication is a common routine used in
	     many applications for solving a particular problem. Matrix-
	     Vector multiplication is an excellent application that can
	     be parallelized easily and achieve better performance with 
	     more powerful hardware. We will explore performance of MatVec
	     routine on GPU using OpenACC directives and see its performance.

Description: In this exercise you will learn how to port a function/subroutine 
	     to GPUs using the OpenACC routine directive. Next we will learn 
	     how to tune the compute kernel using the gang vector clauses. 
	     Finally we will focus on accelerating the application to achieve
             the best performance by running the entire code on GPU.
 
	     We will be using the PGI 15.4 compiler for compiling OpenACC code 
	     and use the CUDA toolkit for profiling code via nvprof.
